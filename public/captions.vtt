00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:09.085
Proprietary multivesicular Liposome technology

1
00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:14.365
or PMVL is an advanced drug delivery platform

2
00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.285
that encapsulates active agents

3
00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.845
with without altering their molecular structure

4
00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.405
and then consistently releases the encapsulated drug over a

5
00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.885
desired period of time.

6
00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.205
PMVL can encapsulate an array

7
00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.405
of therapeutic agents across the molecular weight

8
00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:33.645
and structural spectrum,

9
00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:35.485
and provides the potential

10
00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.365
to treat a wide variety of conditions.

11
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:44.165
The proprietary multivesicular liposomes encapsulate the

12
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:48.285
active agent and are composed of naturally occurring lipids,

13
00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.725
which have been shown to be biocompatible and safe.

14
00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:56.965
PMVL suspensions are provided ready to use.

15
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.965
They require no reconstitution or dilution,

16
00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:08.005
although they may be diluted if desired,

17
00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:09.965
at the discretion of the clinician.

18
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:15.005
PVL suspensions can accommodate the addition

19
00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.285
of an active agent external to the liposomes

20
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.045
with the potential to provide an immediate

21
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.685
therapeutic effect.

22
00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:27.845
Given the low viscosity of the PMVL suspensions,

23
00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.885
they can be administered using small gauge

24
00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:34.405
needles in vivo.

25
00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:38.965
Studies have shown that PMVL suspensions can be administered

26
00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:43.085
by virtually any root, including subcutaneous,

27
00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:48.525
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathecal

28
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:53.645
epidural, and ocular Following administration.

29
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:58.285
The proprietary multivesicular liposomes release the drug

30
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:02.165
consistently and slowly at the site of administration,

31
00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:06.165
so optimal local concentrations can be achieved

32
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.165
with minimal systemic exposure.

33
00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.205
This differential in drug exposure between the target tissue

34
00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.765
and the systemic circulation results in a large

35
00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:19.045
therapeutic window.

36
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.405
Flexible sustained release technology

37
00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:27.725
that can encapsulate an array of therapeutics

38
00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:32.605
to treat innumerable conditions, innovative,

39
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:39.725
customizable, long-acting.

40
00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:46.605
The possibility of proprietary multivesicular liposome,

41
00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:49.245
PVL technology.

42
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:51.445
Yours to imagine

43
00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.635

44
00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:21.195
to produce post-surgical local analgesia via infiltration in

45
00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:22.835
patients aged six years and older

46
00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:26.195
and regional analgesia in adults via an intra galine

47

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:29.915
sciatic nerve block in the papal fossa

49
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.395
and an adductor canal block.

50
00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:33.195

00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:22.795
least 20 minutes or more.

73
00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.875
Following local administration of lidocaine.

74
00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:26.595
XPRL is not recommended

75
00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:28.635
to be used in the following patient populations.

76
00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.115
Patients less than six years old for infiltration

or pregnant patients

79
00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:37.955
because MI type local anesthetics such

80
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:39.955
as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver.

81
00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:41.955
Xprl should be used cautiously in

82
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.195
patients with hepatic disease.

83
00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:45.355

or intraarticular use.

94
00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:08.115
The potential sensory and

95
00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:11.555
or motor loss with EXPAREL is temporary and varies in degree

96
00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:13.475
and duration depending on the site of injection

97
00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:14.635

with the use of local anesthetics.

103
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:31.155
These include persistent anesthesia and paraesthesia.

104
00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:33.115
CNS reactions are characterized

105
00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:34.915
by excitation and or depression.

toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity

108
00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.835
and excitability, which may lead to dysrhythmias,

109
00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:43.835
sometimes leading to death.

00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:48.155
Allergic reactions, allergic type reactions. For example.

111
00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:50.515
Anaphylaxis and angioedema are rare

112
00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.755
and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity

113
00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:55.475
to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients.

intraarticular infusion of local anesthetics,

117
00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.085
